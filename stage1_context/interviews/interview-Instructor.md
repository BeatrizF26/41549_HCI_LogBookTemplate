# Informal User Interview Notes 

## Interview Details 
- **Date:** 2025-02-28
- **Interviewer:** Beatriz Francisco
- **Participant:** Instructor 
- **Context:** At the driving school

## Task Overview 

**Do you usually use a similar platform at your driving school? If not, would you consider it useful?**

Yes, the instructor uses a platform only to register the lessons of each student. However, they would consider it useful to have a more complete platform that also allows students to use it.

**What is the user's role on the platform and how do they typically use it?** 

As a driving instructor, they have their access credentials to the platform. At the beginning of each lesson, the instructor needs to enter their credentials and scan the QR code associated with each student. This allows the IMT (Instituto da Mobilidade e dos Transportes) to register the lesson in the student’s profile.

These are the only features the instructor uses in the platform, which are essentially limited to registering the lesson that the student is attending.

**What are the positive aspects and biggest challenges/disadvantages of using the platform?** 

- A positive aspect of using this platform is that it is directly connected to the IMT, allowing for accurate records of the number of lessons each student has completed. This eliminates the possibility of mistakes in the number of lessons a student has, as could happen with paper records, where inconsistencies could arise and cause errors in matching the number of lessons recorded on paper to the number the student has actually attended.

- However, a disadvantage of this platform is that it does not allow the instructor to consult their class schedule. Normally, the instructor has a schedule at the driving school where the lessons for the day are marked, and the instructor takes a photo of this schedule the day before to know which students they will be teaching the next day.

**Do you use any alternative methods to overcome the difficulties you face when using the application?** 

To access the lessons scheduled for the day, the instructor takes a photo of their agenda where everything is recorded. In case there is any last-minute change, the school’s administration calls the instructor to inform them of the modification.

## Tools & Environment 
**What are the main features you use?** 

As the instructor only has access to one feature, they use the lesson registration feature.

**Although you normally use these features, is there anything you would like to improve?** 

Regarding the registration of lessons, there is nothing they would change, as they believe the process works well and serves its purpose. They do not think improvements can be made to this feature.

**What improvements would you consider most important to implement on the platform?** 
- The most important improvement, considering the tasks the instructor has to perform, would be to implement a calendar showing the lessons the instructor is scheduled to teach, at least for the day.

- In terms of providing feedback to students about their performance, the instructor does not consider this to be a significant improvement, as they typically do this at the end of each lesson. They would prefer to make their comments in a place on the platform where the student could also access them, rather than just keeping them private.

- The instructor normally records, at the end of each lesson, the topics covered in a written document. In their opinion, it would also be interesting to move this task to the platform to reduce the administrative burden.

## Expectations for a Novel Approach 

**With which features implemented would you consider the platform ideal for the tasks you need to perform?** 

In the instructor's opinion, the platform would only be considered ideal when, in addition to the lesson registration feature, it also includes the instructor’s calendar. The other features mentioned would be seen as extra, not essential to their work.

**Would you have any concerns about using a platform like this?** 

There would be no concerns about using the platform.
