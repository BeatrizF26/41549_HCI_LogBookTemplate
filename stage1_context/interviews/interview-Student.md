## Interview Details 
- **Date:** 2025-02-27

- **Participant:** A student who has attended a driving school
- **Context:** HCI Class

## Task Overview 

**Do you usually use a similar platform at your driving school? If not, would you consider it useful?**

Yes, there was a platform, but it was slightly different from the proposed one.

**What is the user's role on the platform and how do they typically use it?** 

The user uses the platform as a student, having access to specific content, such as theoretical lessons and videos that help in the learning process.

**What are the positive aspects and biggest challenges/disadvantages of using the platform?** 

- The main positive aspect of the platform is that it enables distance learning, allowing students to learn certain content without needing to go to the school for a class where the same content would be taught.

- The biggest disadvantage of the platform is that it is only useful for the theoretical component of the driver's license, as once the theory exam is completed, the platform is no longer used since there is no need to watch the theoretical lesson videos anymore.

- Additionally, although the theoretical lessons can be watched remotely, there is no appropriate place on the platform where the user can ask questions.

**Do you use any alternative methods to overcome the difficulties you face when using the application?** 

Since the biggest issue isn't a limitation of the platform but rather how it was designed, there is no alternative within the platform to address it. Therefore, the only alternative is to go to the school whenever the student needs to schedule driving lessons or requires other services.

## Tools & Environment 
**What are the main features you use?** 

Since the platform doesn't offer many features other than watching lessons on specific content, that ends up being the primary feature the user utilizes.

**Although you normally use these features, is there anything you would like to improve?** 

No, in their opinion, there isn't much more to improve about this feature.

**What improvements would you consider most important to implement on the platform?** 

- The main improvement would definitely be to make the platform more useful, not just for the theoretical component of the driver's license.

- Some interesting improvements could be adding a chat feature where students can ask their questions. Additionally, incorporating the platform into the practical driving lessons would be useful. A calendar showing scheduled driving lessons could also be implemented.

- If the platform were to be used for these purposes, students could have access to feedback on their performance during the driving lessons, helping them track their progress over time.

- Furthermore, an improvement would be having access to the payment record for the driving license, such as how much is left to pay or what has already been paid. The platform could also implement a payment system.

## Expectations for a Novel Approach 

**With which features implemented would you consider the platform ideal for the tasks you need to perform?** 

Of the improvements mentioned earlier, the most important features to consider the platform ideal would be implementing the calendar with scheduled driving lessons and the chat for asking questions.

Other improvements would also be important, but in their opinion, they are not as urgent as the others.

**Would you have any concerns about using a platform like this?** 

There would be no concerns; in fact, they would like to use a similar platform to facilitate the entire process of obtaining a driver's license.
