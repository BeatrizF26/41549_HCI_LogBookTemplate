## Interview Details 
- **Date:** 2025-02-28
- **Interviewer:** Beatriz Francisco
- **Participant:** Employee from the Driving School's Administrative Office
- **Context:** At the driving school

## Task Overview 

**Do you usually use a similar platform at your driving school? If not, would you consider it useful?**

Yes, a platform is usually used to register students, view their profiles along with their data, check their payment status for the driver's license and track the number of lessons each students has had.

**What is the user's role on the platform and how do they typically use it?**

The platform is used to facilitate all the administrative processes that a driving school needs to manage. Thus, any staff member working in the administrative office uses the platform to register students, schedule lessons and exams, both theory and practical.

For student registration, various detaails must be filled out, sucha as name, contact information, email, address and medical certificate. If all requires information is provided correctly, the request to register a new student is accepted and sent to the IMT.

Regarding scheduling lessons for each student, the platform can schedule them. However, since instructors do not have access to the calendar, the school opts to schedule each instructor's lessons on a separate agenda, to avoid having to register the lessons twice (once on the platform and once in the agenda).

To access each student's payment status, the administrative office has to manually enter the amount paid by the student since the platform does not have the functionality to process payments or track when and how much has been paid.

**What are the positive aspects and the biggest challenges/disadvantages of using this platform?** 

- One positive aspect of the platform is that it allows for quick and easy student registration and submission of the registration request to the IMT, as long as the platform's requirements are met.
  
- Another positive aspect is that it is possible to schedule theory andd practical exams through the platform, taking into account the available dates for the school to schedule those exams.

- A negative aspect is that although the platform has the functionality to schedule lessos, they cannot fully benefit from it because instructor do not have access to that area of the platform.

- Additionally, having to manually enter the payment amounts makes the process time-consuming.
  
**Do you use any alternative methods to overcome the difficulties you face when using the application?** 

To avoid entering the transfer amount manually every time, sometimes the staff waits until the payments reach a certain value and then registers them in the platform all at once.

Also, since it is not advantageous to use the calendar functionality in the platform, the alternative is to use a separate agenda that instructors can easily consult.

## Tools & Environment 
**What are the main features you use?** 

In the administrative office, the most commonly used features are student registration and scheduling lessons. However, all other features must be functional to ensure there are no issues when they need to be used.

**Although you normally use these features, is there anything you would like to improve?** 

One aspect that could be improved would be to implement a payment system so that the amount the student has paid appears automatically on their profile, eliminating the need for manual entry.

**What improvements do you consider most important to implement on the platform?** 

The main improvement to implement on the platform would be allowing instructors to access their lesson calendar through the platform, so they donâ€™t have to take a photo of their agenda every day. Additionally, if there are any changes to the lessons during the day, the instructor should be notified as soon as an update is made in the calendar, instead of the administrative office having to call them.

## Expectations for a Novel Approach 

**With which features implemented would you consider the platform ideal for the tasks you need to perform?** 

The platform could only be considered ideal when the payment functionality and the scheduling of lessons in the calendar are properly implemented.

**Would you have any concerns about using a platform like this?** 

There would be no concerns, in fact, it would be a way to simplify the tasks that need to be done.
