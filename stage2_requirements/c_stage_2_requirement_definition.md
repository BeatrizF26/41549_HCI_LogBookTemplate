# Scenarios
## Scenario 1: Ricardo's Weekend
This weekend Ricardo came back from Coimbra earlier at 4 PM. He got home at around 4:30 PM and decided to **check his driving school schedule**. He realized he had 2 classes that day, a practical lesson at 7 PM and a theoretical class at 6 PM. He had **booked those classes** at the beginning of the week, however he had forgotten.

He realized he couldn't get to his first class in time so he **messaged his driving instructor and the school's secretary** telling them he couldn't make it to the class and asked if they could change his practical lesson to later that day, at 7 PM after the theoretical class.

At the end of the day, Ricardo realized he did quite well in his theoretical class so he decided to **request a theoretical exam**, however he had not fully paid what he owns to the school so he had to **pay the remaining 500â‚¬**. After that he was able to request his exam.

## Scenario 2: JoÃ£o's Practical Lesson
JoÃ£o arrived at the driving school at 8:30 AM. Before heading to the car, he decides to **check the student list** to see which students are scheduled for the morning.

He notices that one of the students, Maria, is a beginner, so he takes a few minutes to **register his lesson plan**, ensuring it covers basic maneuvers.

During the lesson, Maria struggles with clutch pedal. After the lesson, JoÃ£o gave Maria some feedback but also **wrote a review of Maria's progress** to track her improvement over time.

Before heading to his next lesson, JoÃ£o **received a message from another student**, Ricardo, who asked if they could switch his scheduled session at 5 PM for one at 7 PM. JoÃ£o **opened the chat feature and messaged both Ricardo and the secretary** to arrange a new schedule.

## Scenario 3: Gracinda's Day at the School
Gracinda arrived at the driving school at 9 AM. The first thing she did was **check the list of students** scheduled for practical and theoretical lessons that day to ensure everything was organized.

A new student, Bruno, walked in and said he wanted to enroll in driving lessons. Gracinda guided him through the process, collected his documents, and successfully **registered him as a studen**t in the system.

As she continued with her morning tasks, Gracing **checked the school's payments** and realized a student, Sofia, had paid all she owed to the school so she proceeded to **send Sofia a message** reminding her that she was able to request a theoretical exam already.

Later in the afternoon, JoÃ£o, messaged Gracinda asking if she could help reschedule Ricardoâ€™s practical lesson. She **opened the school's schedule** and found an available slot at 7 PM, confirming the change with JoÃ£o and Ricardo.
