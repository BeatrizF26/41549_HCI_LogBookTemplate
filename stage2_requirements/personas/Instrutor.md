**Name:** João Marques
**Age:** 58
**Occupation:** Instructor
**Location:** Figueira da Foz, Portugal

## Background  
João was born and raised in Lisbon, but over 20 years ago, he moved to Figueira da Foz, where he built his life. João is married and has always had a passion for automobiles. Over 30 years ago, he decided to become a driving instructor. Currently, he works at the "ACADEMIA ACOSTA" Driving School and has helped hundreds of students obtain their driver's license. Although he has extensive experience in teaching driving, he is not very comfortable with technology; however, he is open to a change in how he organizes his work.


## Daily Life  
João's day starts early, with driving lessons right in the morning. He spends most of the day in the car with students, helping them build confidence behind the wheel. Between lessons, he takes the opportunity to have coffee with colleagues. In the evening, he enjoys spending time with his family and watching television.


## Goals & Needs  
João wants to continue teaching and helping students obtain their driver's licenses, but he feels that the increasing digitalization of administrative processes can be a challenge. He would like to adapt better to the use of technological tools that make his work easier, without losing the close, direct contact with his students.


## Pain Points & Challenges  
- There is a lot of bureaucracy involved in the process of obtaining a driver's license, from student registration to exam scheduling.
- Managing lesson schedules can be complicated, especially when there are last-minute reschedules or changes.
- Tracking the progress of each student requires attention and organization, as each student learns at different paces.
- Communication between instructors, the administrative staff, and students is not always smooth, which can lead to confusion regarding deadlines and bookings.

## Motivation  
"Teaching how to drive is my passion, so I want to help my students succeed through direct and transparent contact." - João
