**Name:** Ricardo Fernandes  
**Age:** 18 
**Occupation:** Student 
**Location:** Figueira da Foz, Portugal 

## Background  
Ricardo has always live in Figueira da Foz, but last year he went to University of Coimbra, where he is studying Industrial Engineering and Management.
Although he enjoys the course, the daily commute by bus between the two cities is not always practical.
About a month ago, he decided to sign up for "ACADEMIA ACOSTA" Driving School, located at Rua Coimbra 14, 3080-046 Figueira da Foz, with the aim of obtaining his driver's license as quickly as possible. 


## Daily Life  
During the week, Ricardo wakes up early to catch the bus to Coimbra, where he spends most of his day between classes, studying, and socializing with friends.
Sometimes, on weekends, he goes back to Coimbra to spend time with his friends.
Although he is used to public transport, he feels that the lack of flexibility in the schedules limits his routine and makes the journeys tiring.


## Goals & Needs  
Ricardo's main goal right now is to obtain his driver's license to gain more autonomy and flexibility in his travels. He wants to avoid depending on public transportation schedules and reduce the travel time between Figueira da Foz and Coimbra. Additionally, getting his driver's license will also be a valuable asset for his future.


## Pain Points & Challenges  
- The delays and inconvenience of public transportation, especially on weekends and during evening hours.
- The need to balance university classes with driving lessons, which requires careful planning.
- Concerns about the costs involved in obtaining a driver's license, such as driving lessons and exams.
- Anxiety regarding the theory and practical driving exams, as he has never had experience behind the wheel.

## Motivation  
"I want more freedom to travel without depending on bus schedules. Having a driver's license will make my life easier and give me more independence." - Ricardo
