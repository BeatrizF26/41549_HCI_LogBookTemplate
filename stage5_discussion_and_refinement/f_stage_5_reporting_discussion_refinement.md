# F. Discussion of Evaluation Results

After getting feedback from our testers, although the tests were overall sucessful, we discovered a few things we needed to improve.

# Refinement List
- Redesign the payments section layout to avoid potential confusion.
- Enhance the instructorâ€™s homepage to provide a clearer view of his daily schedule.
- Make it easier for instructors to identify, on student's profile, the last class given, with improved display and organization.
- Adjust minor button color schemes for better visual clarity and consistency.

# Refined Prototype

After identifying some issues, we quickly addressed them and recorded the demo videos with the improvements implemented.
