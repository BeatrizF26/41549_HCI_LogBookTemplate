# Self-Evaluation and Workload

## Work distributed by team

Our main task was to develop the project, which involved three different interfaces: one for the student, one for the instructor, and one for the secretary. We divided the work based on these roles. However, we were not limited to only our assigned interface — each of us contributed to other parts of the project and helped each other when needed.

In addition, all project documentation was created collaboratively by the three of us, including the presentation materials for both Assignment 1 and Assignment 2.

## Challenges

One of our biggest challenges was working with a new programming language and setting up mobile testing environments to simulate the app on real smartphones.

Another difficulty was addressing all user feedback. Sometimes the feedback was contradictory — especially regarding visual elements such as color schemes — which made decision-making more complex.

## Good Aspects
- Our project successfully met the core requirements defined in the initial stages.
- Users showed genuine interest in using the application and considered it useful.

## Improvements and Future Work

- Implement a more efficient database system to ensure secure and fast access to data.

- Further develop the secretary’s version of the system, which we deprioritized initially, as we focused on the student and instructor interfaces as the central components of the application.

## Self-Evaluation
- Beatriz Francisco: 33%
- Pedro Marques: 33%
- Tiago Coelho: 33%

## Proposal for the final grade
18
