# A. Stage 0 - Planning and Problem Identification
>	Here you will briefly explain the domain of the problem you identified, briefly identify general challenges and, then, state you problem

# Context
In a world where mobility is becoming increasingly important, learning how to drive should be considered a priority. 
Therefore, to facilitate the management of a driving school, we propose creating a platform that makes the entire process work more intuitive, easy and simple for all users. 
This platform needs to perform basic tasks, such as registering new students and booking classes, whether theoretical or practical.

One of our goals is to promote interaction between students, instructors and driving schools, as this would allow tracking the number of lessons each student has, scheduling classes and monitoring students' progress. However, it is important to remember that some features are restricted to certain entities. For example, a student cannot assign an instructor to themselves, as this task is exclusively designated to the driving school.

Thus, using this platform in real-life scenarios would be interesting in order to make the management of a driving school more dynamic and organized, representing an advancement in the relationship between students and the school.

# Challenges
Regarding this project, it is importart to mention some challenges that may appear during its development, particularly the need to restrict the features available to each entity and ensure that they only have access to information that are strictly needed.

Furthermore, each driving school has its own working method, meaning there are multiple approaches to its processes, which may lead to greater resistance in adopting the platform. Consequently, our plan to address this is to maximize the platform's ease of use, making it acessible, easy to understand and effective in practice.

By using a more customizable approach, we ensure that working methods are included.

# The goal

Our main goal is to simplify and modernize the management process of a driving school, while simultaneously promoting the interaction between the students and the school.
